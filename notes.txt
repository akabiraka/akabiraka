Installing dependencies:
    actual template: https://github.com/sbryngelson/academic-website-template
    This requires jekyll 4.3.3 (defined in Gemfile). 
    
    sudo apt install git
    
    ### follow this page: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/
    sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev    # install jekyll
    sudo gem install jekyll bundler

git could not deploy from the jekyll codes, so I had to run "rake publish", this creates "_site" folder. Then I renamed it "docs" and pushed it. 
Next, in github settings pages/ select docs/.

Run $ bundle exec jekyll serve in the repository root directory to run it on localhost.
